# Video-streaming-app-nodejs
In this first open your terminal or Visual code terminal
then type this code 'npm init' to get the json file.
Now click enter until you can enter a new command.
You have to install express and nodemon to run this code.
So run this code in terminal "npm install --save express nodemon".
After that create the html file and then create the Nodejs File. After doing all of that include the video in the same folder.
Then run the program. You can see the video being streamed in your chrome browser. To access that video go to
"localhost:8000" there you can view the video and feel free to seek through the video. You can access volume and fullscreen
functions too.
Thank You
